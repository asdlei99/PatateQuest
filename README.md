# PatateQuest
Clone of HeroQuest, with GameBoy graphics. 

I've always wanted to replay my HeroQuest board as an adult, but I don't know enough interested people to play. So I took the rule book and started creating this game so I can play the campaign by myself, controlling all 4 characters. The game master would be controlled by the computer.

If this ever get published, obviously all references to HeroQuest would be removed. It would become a Rogue like and the dungeon most probably randomly generated. It might have a campaign with custom quests. Also the layout of the board would need to be changed.
