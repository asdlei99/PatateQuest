# PatateQuest
Clone of HeroQuest, with GameBoy graphics. 

I've always wanted play my HeroQuest board, but none of my friends are geek enough to play with me. Or just, different kind of geekiness. So I took the rule book and started creating this game so I can play the campaign by myself, controlling all 4 characters. The game master would be controlled by the computer.

If this ever get published, obviously all references to HeroQuest would be removed. It would become a Rogue like and the dungeon most probably randomly generated. It might have a campaign with custom quests. Also the layout of the board would need to be changed.
